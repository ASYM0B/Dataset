        <tokens xsi:type="generator:Literal" text="Covid-19 is transmitted much more readily between humans than its closest relation, Sars, which caused outbreaks of serious disease in a few countries in 2003. The new coronavirus is, however, less dangerous to most people it infects than Sars. Computer modelling suggests that each new Covid-19 case infects 2.5 other people on average when no effort is made to keep people apart. The Chinese authorities have greatly reduced this &#x201c;reproduction number&#x201d; through drastic action to isolate cases and trace their contacts &#x2014; and the rest of the world is rapidly introducing social distancing measures. &#xA;The virus has caused severe respiratory disease in about 20 per cent of patients and killed more than 3 per cent of confirmed cases. Sars killed 10 per cent of infected individuals. Older people, whose immune defences have declined with age, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are much more vulnerable than the young. &#xA;But fatality rates are hard to estimate in the early stages of an epidemic and depend on the medical care given to patients. For example, ventilators save lives by enabling people with pneumonia to breathe. Most experts believe the current fatality rate is exaggerated by serious under-diagnosis of mild cases; the best current estimate is that Covid-19 will kill around 1 per cent of those infected in a population with good healthcare. &#xA;For comparison, seasonal flu has a mortality rate below 0.1 per cent but it infects so many people that it results in about 400,000 deaths a year worldwide. Spanish flu infected an estimated 500m people and killed 50m worldwide in 1918-19. Hypothetically, if Covid-19 affected half the world&#x2019;s current population over the course of a year with a 1 per cent fatality rate, the death toll would be 35m &#x2014; substantially increasing the number of deaths worldwide, which is around 60m for all causes in a typical year."/>

But it is still not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.

        <tokens xsi:type="generator:Literal" text="There are 4 major types of mask available and you should wear mask according to places you go. &#xA; 1. SURGICAL MASK: commonly available form of masks in the market, surgical masks protect a person against large splashes of droplets, water, sprays and used in medical facilities. While they do cover your mouth, surgical masks can't really protect you from catching or transmitting the coronavirus or any such microbe in the air, since it has loose gaps which can help the germs crawl in. A high-grade surgical mask can stop the transmission of different kinds of viruses (up to 80-90%), especially if used by a person who is sick. If the wearer coughs or sneezes, the surgical mask will help collect the larger particles expelled. The price of surgical mask is between Rs.1 to Rs. 20. &#xA;2. N95 and FFP1: Masks with N95 rating filter 95% of particles 0.3 microns or larger in diameter, roughly the size of a single virus and include PM 2.5. Some masks also have an attachment called the exhalation valve, which can filter out humidity build-up and is best for those having suffocation problem. Compared to all other masks, N95 masks offer the highest level of protection Price of N95 mask start from Rs.150 and KN95 mask Rs. 60 (similar to N95 with little different in leak of exhalation valve. N95 is better than KN 95. Both mask come with and without exhalation valve.) &#xA; FFP1 masks are considered an alternative to respiratory masks, such as the N95 ones. FFP1 masks protect a person from breathing in particles of more hazardous quality. Price of FFP1 mask start from Rs. 30. &#xA;3. ACTIVATED CARBON MASKS: these masks contain an activated carbon filter, which help collect and filter out the pollutants and germs and breathe in purer air. these masks work very well in fighting pollution and tiny particles like bacteria and fungi which spread through the air we breathe in, and thereby, prevent allergies. However, they do not work exceptionally well in fighting or preventing viruses like COVID-19 from coming in contact. They can only trap a minuscule number of viruses (10-20%) and hence, may not be the best choice right now. The price starts from Rs.40. &#xA; 4. CLOTH MASKS: Homemade masks offer LESSER protection than surgical or respirator masks. However, as the WHO guidelines read, they can help a person keep the face area clean and prevent the spread of nasty germs and other contagious viruses. Sanitization and disinfecting are crucial steps which can prevent and stop the spread of coronavirus. Cloth and sponge masks filter out about 50% of bacteria and dust pollutants."/>

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that are highly specific for whichever infection a person has previously encountered. They are produced in vast quantities by B cells of our immune system in order to bind to the invading virus and then target it for destruction. The concept of vaccination relies on stimulating antibody production to infections not yet met. In contrast, using convalescent plasma involves the transfer of antibodies from donors who have already mounted an immune response, thus offering immediate (but transient) protection to the recipient. &#xA;Worldwide there are over 60 clinical trials actively recruiting COVID-19 patients to study the effect of convalescent plasma. Patients are typically given about 500ml plasma intravenously, and their progress is then carefully monitored. Many studies are using plasma from non-infected patients as the placebo arm of the trial, to ensure that any benefits identified are indeed specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."/>

WHO is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.&#xA;Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.&#xA;At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19."/>
