# Dataset
ASYM0B (A framework for SYsteMatically assessment Of chatBots) is a framework to analyse and assess conversational agents or chatbots built in different tools. To support chatbots from different platforms, ASYM0B relies on a neutral chatbot definition called [CONGA](https://saraperezsoler.github.io/CONGA/).

The repository contains a dataset used in evaluations of the ASYMOB tool of 259 chatbots in CONGA format from 4 different sources: Code repositories like Github, predefined chatbots from the Dialogflow and Rasa platforms, as well as predefined bots from other platforms, like [Kommunicate](https://www.kommunicate.io/). The following table summarizes the content of the dataset. We classify the chatbots as open source, if they were located in an open-source repository, or predefined, if they are available as prebuilt agents in some platform.

| Dialogflow  |     14    | Dialogflow |  Predefined |
